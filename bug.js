In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error arises when the data source changes rapidly, causing the component to not re-render correctly and leading to visual glitches or incorrect display of items.  This often occurs when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or updates.  The `keyExtractor` prop for FlatList isn't uniquely identifying each item, leading to re-renders that don't properly update.

Example (problematic):
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={this.state.data}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>
```

This is particularly noticeable when adding or removing items from the beginning of the list.  Items might disappear, flicker, or appear in the wrong positions.
