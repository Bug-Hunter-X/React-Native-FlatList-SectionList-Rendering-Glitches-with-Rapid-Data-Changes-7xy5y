The solution involves ensuring a unique key for each item using the `keyExtractor` prop. The key must uniquely identify each item within the dataset, even as the data changes.  It's recommended to use the item's unique ID, if available.  Additionally, consider using `data.slice(0)` to create a copy of the array instead of directly modifying the state, particularly when changing data at the beginning.

Example (solution):
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={this.state.data}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>
```

By ensuring unique keys, React Native can accurately track changes and re-render the list efficiently. If you need to mutate the data at the beginning, create a new array and update the state with this copy (using the spread operator or similar). This prevents in-place mutations which can confuse the rendering mechanism of FlatList.
