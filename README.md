# React Native FlatList/SectionList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in React Native's FlatList and SectionList components. The issue occurs when the data source is updated rapidly, and the `keyExtractor` prop isn't properly configured or when the data source is changed rapidly. This can lead to visual glitches where items disappear, flicker, or appear in the wrong positions.

## Bug Description

The bug is reproduced when data changes dynamically, such as when fetching data from an API or performing operations that modify the data array.  The primary issue stems from the `FlatList` or `SectionList` not effectively identifying changes in the data array.  The absence of a proper or unique `keyExtractor` exacerbates the issue, causing improper item updates and re-renders.  This is most apparent when modifications happen at the beginning of the list.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the glitches in the list as data is added or removed rapidly (this may require rapid user input or simulated rapid changes to the data source).
